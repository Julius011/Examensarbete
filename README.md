# Examensarbete
My thesis is a game that will be based on various inspirations I got from books, Manwha, MMORPG games, Souls-like games, and RPG games. The game will take place in a multi-story tower, with each floor offering new missions, challenges, environments, and objectives. Each floor will have its own unique story and actions, which will affect players in different ways depending on their choices and decisions.
The game will primarily be a single-player experience, but there will also be the option to play in co-op mode. The co-op experience will be similar to the Dark Souls games, where players can cooperate and help each other through the tower's dangers and challenges. The camera perspective will be in a top-down view for example similar to the game Stardew Valley, however, I do not want the game camera to be like in Divinity: Original Sin 2 without it being focused on the player. The game will also try to have charming pixel art graphics. However, I do not want the game's "battle system" to be a hack and slash or turn-based, but more free and lively, as in, for example, the Dark Souls games or World Of Warcraft.
I have the idea to develop "Turris" using SDL or similar. Also, I plan to create a forum using HTML/CSS/JavaScript where players can interact with each other and get information about upcoming events, similar to OPTC.

What I hope to implement:
Possibility to play with other people. The game will try to support multiplayer where 1-4 players can play simultaneously and explore the tower together.
Interaction with the community. Through the created forum, players will be able to interact with each other, share strategies, and discuss the game. This will foster a strong community and enable the exchange of information about upcoming events and updates.
Interactive floors. Each floor of the tower will be unique and offer different challenges, missions, and environments. There will be a variety of enemies, traps, and puzzles that players must overcome. Additionally, NPCs will affect the player and the state of the floors based on the player's past choices and actions.
Awesome soundtrack. The game will have a memorable and atmospheric soundtrack that enhances the gaming experience and makes the players feel immersed in the world of the game.
Customization possibilities. Players will have the opportunity to customize their character with, for example, different clothes, armor, weapons, artifacts, gifts, familiars, and classes. This will give players a sense of individuality and allow them to create their own play style and strategy.
